                        <h2>Early Check-In</h2>
                        <p>In an event there is another group of guest checking out on the same day at 12pm, check in will be at 3pm as my Housekeeper needs some time to clean the house. If there is no one checking out on that day, we are more than happy to allow early check in.</p>
                        <p>Do note that check in before 12pm will incur a half day charge (subject to availability). Will keep you updated at a nearer date.</p>
                        <p>Alternatively, if you reached the apartment early and the housekeeper is still cleaning the house, you can leave your luggage in the house and we will hand over the house as soon as the cleaning is completed.</p>

                        <h2>Late Check-In</h2>
                        <p>Do note that there is a late check in fee of RM50 for check in at 6PM-10PM as mentioned previously to cover our transport and manpower cost. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        <h2>Late Check-Out</h2>
                        <p>Our check out timing is normally at 12PM as the housekeeper will need to clean the house for the next guest by 3PM.</p>
                        <p>However if there is no guest checking in on the same day, we are more than happy to offer late check out, latest by 2pm.</p>
                        <p>Do note that check out after 2pm will incur a half day charge (subject to availability). </p>

                        <h2>Security Deposit</h2>
                        <p>The security deposit will not be charged on the credit card by AirBnB, it is just an acknowledgement that there is a security deposit involved, which is claimable by the host if there are any damages. We will not collect any monies in cash, as off-site payments are a violation of AirBnB terms.</p>
                        <p>
                            Do take a look at AirBnB's official reply on security deposit, hope this helps.

                        <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
                        <p>Our cancellation policy is stated as moderate: https://www.airbnb.com/home/cancellation_policies#moderate</p>
                        <p>"If the guest cancels less than 5 days in advance, the first night is non-refundable but 50% of the accommodation fees for remaining nights will be refunded."</p>
                        <p>Understand that the request is made to request us to refund.</p>
                        <p>We've read through the cancellation policy: </p>
                        <p>For a full refund of accommodation fees, cancellation must be made five full days prior to listingâ€™s local check in time (or 3:00 PM if not specified) on the day of check in. For example, if check-in is on Friday, cancel by the previous Sunday before check in time.</p>
                        <p>
                            If the guest cancels less than 5 days in advance, the first night is non-refundable but 50% of the accommodation fees for remaining nights will be refunded."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We fully understand your situation. However for us as host, if a cancellation is made less than 5 days (for your case is on the same booking day) it will be challenge for us to get another booking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For us host we are facing lots of challenges, guests asking for refunds and discount for the smallest matters. We as host cannot cancel on our end as if we cancel our booking, our ratings will drop and we are out in consideration for SuperHost renewal every quarter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Would appreciate if you can cancel on your end. Thank you!

                        <p>
                            We have a no smoking policy in our apartment as part of our efforts to help you quit smoking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Feel free to use our kitchen to be a Gordon Ramsay wannabe but strivtly light-cooking only and do kindly clean up after usage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Leave your worries and your shoes on the shoe rack near the door.
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Take nothing, including our furniture, accessories etc, but memories from our apartment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To save our Mother Nature, at the same time keep our costs down, kindly switch off all electrical appliances including lights and air-con units when not in use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Kindly keep things on the quieter-side after 9PM to be considerate to our neighbours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our access card will make you feel that nothing can stop you at our building, but a replacement fee of RM50 will be levied for any loss or damage of access card.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Arriving slightly later than our check-in timing at 3-5pm? Should be fine, but please check with us first before making your booking and we can make alternative arrangements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Keep our apartment CLEAN and TIDY, just like your home. Together we create a pleasant homestay community for guests and hosts.
